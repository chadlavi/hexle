# What the hexle?

[Hexle](https://chadlavi.github.io/hexle/) challenges you to guess a randomly
generated CSS [RGB color
code](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_colors_rgb.asp).

## Gameplay

The R (red), G (green), and B (blue) values of the hex code are entered
separately. Only valid hex color values (i.e., hexadecimal numbers between 00
and ff) are accepted.

You can guess as many times as you want.

### Correct values in guesses

Correctly guessed color values are shown in green.

### Close values in guesses

Close guesses are shown in yellow.

### Other values in guesses

Guesses that are not close are shown in grey.

### Lower/higher indicators

Guesses that are not correct will have either a lower or higher indicator.

When the correct value is higher than the value you guessed, there will be a bar
at the top of the guess.

When the correct value is lower than the value you guessed, there will be a bar
at the bottom of the guess.

### Comparing your guess to the correct color

At the right of the guess, the color you guessed (left) and the correct color
(right) are shown side by side for easy comparison in making your next guess.

## How many times can I play per day?

I dunno, like a million I guess? The random color is generated when you load the
page, and it's different for everyone (unless it happens to be the same; there
are only 16,581,375 unique hex colors). You can just reload the page to play
again.

## Couldn't I just cheat with dev tools?

Yeah, sure. Go nuts. I'm not going to stop you. But what's the fun in that?

This game is sorta kinda like wordle.
